      "Of course. That's a frustrating error to run into. The \"Failed Precondition\" error is a common API error that essentially means: **\"The state of the system is not right for the request you're trying to make.\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of uploading a video to Gemini 1.5 Pro (the current multimodal model, as of now), it means one or more of the requirements for the video file or your project setup were not met *before* you made the API call.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the most common reasons for this error, broken down into a checklist you can go through.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Category 1: The Video File Itself (Most Likely Cause)\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the most common source of the problem. The model has strict requirements for the media it can process.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Unsupported File Format (MIME Type):** Gemini can't process every video codec or container.\n",
      "    *   **Supported Formats:** MP4, MPEG, MOV, AVI, FLV, WEBM, WMV.\n",
      "    *   **What to do:** Ensure your video is in one of these formats. If you have something like a `.MKV` file, you will need to convert it to a supported format like `.MP4` using a tool like [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) or FFmpeg.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **File is Too Large:** There are limits to the size of a single file you can upload.\n",
      "    *   **The Limit:** The current limit is typically **2GB** per file.\n",
      "    *   **What to do:** Check your video's file size. If it's larger than 2GB, you'll need to compress it or use a shorter/lower-resolution clip.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **File is Corrupted:** The upload might have completed, but the file itself could be unreadable.\n",
      "    *   **What to do:** Try playing the video file on your local machine to ensure it's not corrupted. If you uploaded it to Google Cloud Storage, try downloading it back and playing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Exceeding Total Upload Limits:** While a single file can be 2GB, there might be limits on the total number of files or total data size in a single request.\n",
      "    *   **The Limit:** You can typically provide up to 10 files in a single request, with the total size not exceeding 2GB.\n",
      "    *   **What to do:** If you are sending multiple files, ensure you are within these limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Category 2: How You're Providing the File (The Upload Method)\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're using a service like Vertex AI, you typically upload the video to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) first and then provide the model with a link (a `gs://` URI).\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Incorrect Google Cloud Storage (GCS) URI:** The path to your file might be wrong.\n",
      "    *   **Correct Format:** `gs://your-bucket-name/path/to/your/video.mp4`\n",
      "    *   **What to do:** Double-check that the bucket name and the full path to the object are spelled correctly and that there are no typos.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **GCS Bucket Permissions:** This is a very common \"precondition\" failure. The Gemini model's service account needs permission to read the file from your GCS bucket.\n",
      "    *   **The Problem:** By default, files in GCS are private. The AI model can't access them unless you grant it permission.\n",
      "    *   **What to do:** Grant the **\"Storage Object Viewer\"** role to the service account that Vertex AI uses. You can also make the specific video file public for a quick test, but granting the correct role is the secure, long-term solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **File Not Done Uploading:** You might be sending the API request with the GCS URI *before* the video has actually finished uploading to the bucket. This is a classic race condition.\n",
      "    *   **What to do:** Ensure your code waits for the upload to complete successfully before you make the call to the Gemini API.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Category 3: Your Project and API Setup\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes the issue isn't the file, but the configuration of your Google Cloud project.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **APIs Not Enabled:** You must have the correct APIs enabled in your Google Cloud project.\n",
      "    *   **Required API:** You need the **\"Vertex AI API\"** enabled.\n",
      "    *   **What to do:** Go to the Google Cloud Console, navigate to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Library\", and search for \"Vertex AI API\". Make sure it is enabled for your project.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Billing Not Enabled:** Most Google Cloud services, including Vertex AI, require a billing account to be linked to your project.\n",
      "    *   **What to do:** Check the \"Billing\" section of the Google Cloud Console to ensure your project is linked to an active billing account.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Incorrect Location/Region:** You might be trying to make the API call to a region where Gemini 1.5 Pro is not yet available or where your GCS bucket is not located.\n",
      "    *   **What to do:** Ensure that your API endpoint and your GCS bucket are in compatible and supported regions (e.g., `us-central1`).\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to Troubleshoot: A Step-by-Step Plan\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Check the File:**\n",
      "    *   What is its format? (Is it `.mp4`, `.mov`, etc.?)\n",
      "    *   What is its size? (Is it under 2GB?)\n",
      "    *   Can you play it locally without errors?\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Verify the Upload (if using GCS):**\n",
      "    *   Log into the Google Cloud Console and navigate to your GCS bucket.\n",
      "    *   Can you see the file there?\n",
      "    *   Is the name *exactly* the same as in your `gs://` URI?\n",
      "    *   Try downloading it from GCS and playing it to confirm it's not corrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Check Permissions (if using GCS):**\n",
      "    *   As a quick (but insecure) test, select the file in the GCS console, click \"Edit access,\" and add a new principal `allUsers` with the role `Storage Object Viewer`. This makes the file public. **Try your API call again. If it works, you know it's a permission issue.**\n",
      "    *   **Remember to remove public access afterwards** and set up the proper IAM permissions for the Vertex AI service account.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Review Project Settings:**\n",
      "    *   Go to your project's dashboard in Google Cloud.\n",
      "    *   Confirm the Vertex AI API is enabled.\n",
      "    *   Confirm billing is active.\n",
      "\n",
      "By systematically checking these points, you will almost certainly find the reason for the \"Failed Precondition\" error.\n"
